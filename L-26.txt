>>.CONVOLUTION IS TECHNIQUE which is same used by are eye.
>>.resize of feature is done by pooling also called subsampling
>>.NN= fully connected layer
>>. typically pool size is 2x2
>>.before feed to pooling layer we use 'relu' activation funtionn 
>>.we have to hit and trial for no. crp
>>.CNN is just a architecture
>>.learned and searched about  LENET and ALEXNET
>>.in image if we do anything then the pixel chnges but our object will remain same (for ex: crop or resize)
>>.if want to increase our dataset from old dataset just by manipualting the images called augumented . to do so we have to see keras documntation 
>>.in this search about augumentaion 
>>. doing augumentation also means preprocessing
>>.to import a model we load a funtion in keras 
 	c:from kers.models impor load_moedal
 	 c: model = load_model('')
the data for prediction we are giving should be same as the data given for training 
>>.the data we are for prediction should be same as the data for triang 
to do so we have to chng the test_data
c: from preprocessing import image 
test_image =image.load.image('foldename',image size=())
>>. to convert prediction dataimage into numpy and it should be in 4d 
	C:test_image = image.image+to+array(test_image)
converting numpy into 3d into 4d 
	c:test_image =np.expand_dims(test_image,axis=0)
>>.now if we do prediction then it will give 0 and 1
>>.to see what is zero and one 
	c: trainig_set.class.indices

>>. the only use case of docker is to give env as soon as possible 
>>.if docker is os terminate then we have to run it agian manually means it will be slow 
>>. so to overcome this we have tool which will mange the docker called kUbernetes
